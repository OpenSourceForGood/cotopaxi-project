OpenWest Conference 

Community development is a reciprocal process. We invite you to join us and explore the potential of the open source methodology in the social sector.

Quick facts - Refugees in Utah:

1. 60k refugees, mostly in Salt Lake Valley, ~25 communities

2. Last year along there were about 1200 refugees resettled. This year expecting 1,200-1,300. 

3. Service providers are expecting a few new groups - Congolese, Syrian, Somali and Sudanese.

Community Development Principles: 

* Solutions should focus on the simple and impactful. 

* Have patience and build solutions that work for the long term. 

* Listen. Be nimble, adjust. Iterate. Pilot. Test.

IRC

Could we build a platform that has the basic architecture. They plug in the specifics: 

* Lesson plans 

* Links to resources

* Communication exchange to volunteers and clients

* Easy for clients to access

* Easy for IRC to populate

Localization + languages: Arabic, Somali, Nepali, Swahili, Tingrinye, French, Spanish, Kirundi, Farsi

Provides a voice to the client back to the IRC. 

Would increase access to resource opportunities.

As new resources are introduced or are changed, the IRC can share that information as outreach through the app.

Client identifies language or IRC assigns language. App is presented in English & first language. Can we do a voice for each question?

Health: 

* When are immunizations due

* When is their appt

Microenterprise: 

* When is your loan due

Survey section: IRC sends out every 6 months. Building a framework for the IRC to track longitudinal data. Survey completion rate. Trigger a reward or gift card for every survey completed. IRC needs to be able to run a report to see how people responded so they can case manage appropriately.

* How are people progressing

* Is there a need for the IRC to loop back and provide follow up services

* IRC needs to be able to identify the person

    * If it’s someone the IRC didn’t case manage, they’d need fields for first name, last name, date of birth, country of origin, primary language, and number of people in household, phone, email

* Housing: 

    * Are you in the same housing or have you moved

    * Rent payment

* Employment

    * Are you in the same job, changed or unemployed. 

        * If they tick the unemployed box, it triggers a resource link for how to help.

    * Current hourly pay rate + hours worked per week

    * Do you have a savings account

    * Do you have a credit score? If so, what is it? Are you interested in building your credit? Provide a link to the resource with how to contact the IRC.

* Education

    * Are you able to read your mail in English

    * Are you able to have appts without interpreters

    * Are your children passing school

Use case: 

* family tracking each of these tiers

Not public: 

* Drag and drop fields that help them build templates for each of their program areas

Economic Empowerment

Health

Education

Safety

Client Services 

User object

* parameters

* attributes

* fields 

Interactivity

* resources

Push notifications

Survey attributes 

Use case

* we want user x to be able to log into the app and find resources that pertain to their needs

* we want the IRC to be able to push a survey to all registered users

* Data infrastructure

    * User object

    * Survey object

Goal: Build a world class that addresses the above.

Frame the challenge: We have these refugees that go through our programs. We don’t want to lose them at 24 months. It helps us strengthen our community, connect to resources, etc.

We have a need. 1st half hour is a spec session. We talk through the use cases. Have a moderator who can translate into architecture on a white board. We build the full architecture. Outcome is vetted by a technical group. 

Max 10 people per group. Have groups present their solutions.

Outcome: 

* Create the application architecture and the data model and resource requirements to build it.
