# IRC Refugee Project

Community development is a reciprocal process. We invite you to join us and explore the potential of the open source methodology in the social sector.

### Quick facts - Refugees in Utah:

* 60k refugees, mostly in Salt Lake Valley, ~25 communities

* Last year along there were about 1200 refugees resettled. This year expecting 1,200-1,300. 

* Service providers are expecting a few new groups - Congolese, Syrian, Somali and Sudanese.

### Community Development Principles: 

* Solutions should focus on the simple and impactful. 

* Have patience and build solutions that work for the long term. 

* Listen. Be nimble, adjust. Iterate. Pilot. Test.

### IRC Ask

The IRC helps settle refugees over a 24 month period where they prepare them to be self sufficient.  After those 24 months they leave the IRC system.  They need a way to continue to track and support these individuals and provide help if there are indications of problems.

Could we build a platform that includes the following: 

* Periodic surveys to check for progress and potential problems

* Links to resources

* Communication exchange to volunteers and clients

* Easy for clients to access

* Easy for IRC to populate

* Notifications for important refugee activities (immunization appointments for them and their children)

Localization + languages: Arabic, Somali, Nepali, Swahili, Tingrinye, French, Spanish, Kirundi, Farsi

Provides a voice from the client back to the IRC. 

Would increase access to resource opportunities.

As new resources are introduced or are changed, the IRC can share that information as outreach through the app.

Client identifies language or IRC assigns language. App is presented in English & first language. 


Survey section: IRC sends out every 6 months. Building a framework for the IRC to track longitudinal data. Survey completion rate. Trigger a reward or gift card for every survey completed. IRC needs to be able to run a report to see how people responded so they can case manage appropriately.

* How are people progressing

* Is there a need for the IRC to loop back and provide follow up services
